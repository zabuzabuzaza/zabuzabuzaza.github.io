                            I was a structural steel detailer at ELLUC Projects. Here's what I did there. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every project, a model of all structural steel elements would be constructed from the received civil and architectural plans from the engineers in Tekla Structures. This includes every column, beam, rafter, purlin, and every connection in between them. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marking plans for the project were made, which needs to convey the specifications of the entire project in a readable format. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hundreds and assembly drawings, and thousands of part drawings per project, were annotated correctly with the specifications required for the manufacturers to get it made. This includes keep track of the complete set of parts and elements of the project, down to the last M20 bolt. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't forget a continuous relay of communication between the engineers for any possible clarification / modifications to the design plans, and between the manufacturers for additional project deliverables, or missing / incorrect information we need to amend. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was over a 15 month period, where I joined as a part of 3 new trainee drafters (them on the precast team, me on steel), learning a completely new software withut the main detialing supervisor and trainer for our first few months on the job. We quickly adapted, due to our ability to communicate effectively with our seniors, learning from them without being too annoying, and also due to a fight-or-flight response to most of the senior detailers in the Aus team leaving the company, leaving us as the most experienced detailers left. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the seniors left, more juniors joined to replace them, and it was up to me (now a senior with a whopping 3 months of experience) to train them, and I did. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end, I was part of massive government projects, working with around 20 other people in the Philippines, who we had to communicate and coordinate workloads effectively, as well as handling projects entirely myself (which was much easier to organise honestly). Outside of technical work inside Tekla Structures, we had to keep project files and deliverables organised and clean, work allocation clear and distinct (to avoid sync issues), and communication between stakeholders presentable, and professional.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, the Aus team was ultimately let go as the company was downsizing and refocusing it's efforts towards engineering consultation over detailing services. It was a tumultuous time, as it usually is with a small bisuness trying to find its footing in a competitive industry, but the people I worked with all made the 2 hour commute I took each way to work a worthwhile decision.

                        Hopefully looking back at 25 year old me and being proud of his choices that lead up to future me, maybe even embarrassed that I was that way, because it shows improvement and change.

                        I used to be the person that wanted to plan things in advance. 15 year old me was looking for apartments in Virginia close to Langley Research Center once I got a job at NASA. I am NOT surprised that didn't happen as planned. These day, I tend to take things as they come -- you really can't predict anything. (Why Langley Center specifically...?)

                        When I watched the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, and the Thing (played by Michael Chiklas) returns home in his rock-form, and his wife didn't accept him, leaving him in the phone booth in the rain all sad and depressed, a horrifying freak of nature. I'm not joking. I genuinely shed a tear.

                        On a related note, my favourtie movies are Blowup (the Antonioni film, never seen the John Travolta one) or Edge of Tomorrow.
