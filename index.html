                        I've only ever taken two sick days in 5 years. And for one of those, it was only because COVID made me really sleepy and I missed my alarm.

                        Was the last person at my job that didn't leave due to pay or work-environment. Literally took the company downsizing to get me to leave.

                        At the same job, I commuted 2 hours each way to work, 5 days a week, just to work at a computer and have virtual meetings all day. And I would do it again, cause I sat next to some lovely people.

                            Every project, a model of all structural steel elements would be constructed from the received civil and architectural plans from the engineers in Tekla Structures. This includes every column, beam, rafter, purlin, and every connection in between.

                        <p>
                            Marking plans for the project were made, which need to convey the specifications of the entire project in a readable format.

                            Hundreds of assembly drawings, and more than a thousand part drawings per project, were annotated correctly with the specifications required for the manufacturers to get it made. This includes keeping track of the complete set of parts and elements of the project, down to the last M20 bolt.

                            Don't forget a continuous relay of communication between the engineers for any possible clarification / modifications to the design plans, and between the manufacturers for additional project deliverables, or missing / incorrect information we need to amend.

                            This was over a 15 month period, where I joined as a part of 3 new trainee drafters (they were on the precast team, I was on steel), learning a completely new software without the main detailing supervisor and trainer for our first few months on the job. We quickly adapted, due to our ability to communicate effectively with our seniors, learning from them without being too annoying, and also due to a fight-or-flight response to most of the senior detailers in the Aus team leaving the company, leaving us as the most experienced detailers left. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the seniors left, more juniors joined to replace them, and it was up to me (now a senior with a whopping 3 months of experience) to train them, and I did. 
                        </p>

                            By the end, I was part of a variety of projects ranging from warehouses, school buildings, to massive government projects, working with around 20 other people in the Philippines, who we had to communicate and coordinate workloads effectively, as well as handling projects entirely by myself (which was much easier to organise honestly). Outside of technical work inside Tekla Structures, we had to keep project files and deliverables organised and clean, work allocation clear and distinct (to avoid sync issues), and communication between stakeholders presentable and professional.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, the Aus team was ultimately let go as the company was downsizing and refocusing its efforts towards engineering consultation over detailing services. It was a tumultuous time, as it usually is with a small business trying to find its footing in a competitive industry, but the people I worked with all made the 2 hour commute I took each way to work a worthwhile decision.

                        I used to be the person that wanted to plan things in advance. 15 year old me was looking for apartments in Virginia close to Langley Research Center once I got a job at NASA. I am NOT surprised that didn't happen as planned. These day, I tend to take things as they come -- you really can't predict anything. (Why Langley Center specifically I wonder...?)

                        When I watched the 2005 Fantastic Four movie a few months ago, and the Thing (played by Michael Chiklas) returns home in his rock-form, and his wife looked out the apartment window and didn't accept him, leaving him in the phone booth in the dark all sad and depressed, a horrifying freak of nature. I'm not joking. I genuinely shed a tear. Still not a great movie, but what a weird moment of sincerity and humanity...
