% \section*{Accomplishments}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Best Water Purification Treatment Prototype - ENGG1100 Engineering Design Project}
    
%     In a team of six, we were tasked with the design and fabrication of a water purification device that would be able to treat non-potable water. 

%     \item \textbf{Golden Shockie Award - MECH3200 Advanced Dynamics and Vibrations}
    
%     In a team of eight, we investigated the phenomenon of "sympathetic vibration", or "coupled oscillation", and constructed a demonstration model. The team was awarded the Golden Shockie for \emph{the most effective demonstration of a concept in advanced dynamics and vibrations}.

%     % In a team of eight, we investigated the phenomenon of "sympathetic vibration", or "coupled oscillation", where the interations of two oscillators connected by a medium (straight rod, string, wall) would cause the two oscillations to influence the other's period, as so to eventually sync both frequencies up. The team was awarded the Golden Shockie for \emph{the most effective demonstration of a concept in advanced dynamics and vibrations}.
