\textbf{
    {{.PositionName}}
}

I'm expressing interest in applying for the {{ .PositionName }} position situated in {{ .Location }}. I hope that what I lack in experience, I will make up for in raw enthusiasm, and an aptitude for learning and adapting. 

First off, please visit my website \underline{\textbf{\href{https://zabuzabuzaza.github.io/home/dear_recruiters/}{here}}}. It's a little site I made from scratch over a weekend specifically for hiring managers and recruiters. I've spent a while on this job search for graduate engineering positions, and no-one has appreciated it so far, so I hope you do. It conveys my ability to learn things quickly and adapt, and hopefully it's much more interesting to read than another boring cover letter. 

My experience as a structural steel detailer and drafter may not provide much correlation here, but I do hope the professional skills and experience I got from there can be carried over here. I'm very quick at picking up new software and learning team processes / organisation etc. I got used to getting instructions from the regional manager, to supervising senior engineers all the way in the Philippines, and delegating that with the rest of the junior drafters that I was in charge of. There would be days where I would be working on a single project, going through maybe hundreds of drawings to create and annotate, and some days, where I would be multitasking and hopping between projects to help finish off for submission or for checking. Not only was I required to learn many different building and construction standards, there'd be a lot of document and data management, resource management with team members, and of course keeping a good eye on the time. And since it was such a small team, I had many other duties that included general office restocking and maintenence, IT support and onboarding, and I was in charge of the office speaker (playlist on the website). I'm not saying I'll be perfect for the job, but I'll make up for it in enthusiasm and a desperate need to prove myself. 

Outside of my professional career so far, I have been continuously engaged with improving my software engineering skills, which were initially an outlet for creativily during my degree, which slowly morphed into a very practical demonstration of my critical thinking skills, and ability to learn things quickly. There are a few examples linked on my website, but can you also believe that this cover letter was generated by one of my scripts? Of course, it was still written my hand (LLMs can't replicate that human touch), but the replacement of the position information, dates, locations, as well as the formatting and generation of the pdf were all handled by a Golang script with pdfLatex, all with a UI hosted on a local server. This is just one example of the many skills I've developed, not just to look good on a CV, but to improve my own life (and hopefully your business's). 

I want to stress that I will stay at absolutely any job. I was literally the only drafter left in the company before they had to let me go as it was downsizing, after everyone else left due to the pay, the horrible management, and the pay. I have no affinity for the engineering profession, and will pursue any career path that I find fulfilling and rewarding. Otherwise, why would I apply if I didn't want the job?

If you're still interested in what I have to offer, I would be delighted to have a conversation with you to see if I'm right for the position. Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you soon. 

\closing{Cheers,}

\end{letter}
