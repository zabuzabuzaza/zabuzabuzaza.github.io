% technical job 

I am expressing interest in applying for the {{ .PositionName }} position situated on the {{ .Location }}. 

Please give me a chance. I'm nearly a year into my job search, and despite every single recruiter that I talk to saying my CV looks fine, I am still unemployed. So I realised there's only one thing left that I have yet to try. 

Please. I beg you. Please give me a job. I suffered through an entire engineering degree for you. I suffered through a real analysis maths coruse for you. Did you know you have to re-learn what addition is based on fundamental axioms known as the Peono axioms in that degree? I suffered through 3 different statics and dynamics classes, and 3 thermodymanics classes for you. I learnt Python, and C++ for you. I had to work 25 hour weeks just to pay for that degree. And in the end, I still couldn't get a job. So ehre I am, begging you for one. 

I get it. The unrelenting gluttonous utility monster known as capitalism stops for no-one, especially not someone like me. Companies are afraid to hire anyone, in case they accidently make a mistake, and cost the firm millions of dollars in damages. But please. I wont touch anything. It's not like the last place that gave me a chance, I became team leader in a 5 months after only just learning the software. I know it's scientifically proven that people are unable to learn anything after the age of 25, but give me a chance, and I can prove you wrong. (Sarcasm, but seeing as recruiters dismiss ALL applications that don't meet expereince requirements, irregardless of potential or provan academic / professional aptitude, maybe not as sarcastic as I thought...) I hope I've made it abundantly clear how desperate I am at this point. Please let me into white collar society. I know my kind isn't welcome there, but I would do anything to justify the \$40000 purchase my naive 17 year old self was tricked into buying. 

If you didn't do it already, please visit my personal website that I made over a weekend SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR YOU. It'll take a minute of your time, and will be way more entertaining than you reading another basic boring cover letter. \textbf{\href{https://zabuzabuzaza.github.io/home/dear_recruiters/}{VISIT MY WEBSITE}}

You may or may not have any idea what went into the website, but I hope the initiative I took just to make it for oyu was enough to at least warrant a phone call and not another automated rejection letter. (Seriously, if you hand write a rejection letter instead, I will love you for it and delay my suicide). 

Honestly, I'm fine with rejection. But please at least confirm that you're visiting my website, and ANY feedback with regards to my application (be as brutally honest) is worth as much as a job offer (would prefer the offer, but I'll take any sort of feedback at this point).

\closing{Cheers,}

\end{letter}
