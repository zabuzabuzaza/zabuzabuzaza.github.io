# An OK Palette Generator 

Based on the OKLAB / LCH colourspace by Bj√∂rn Ottosson outlined [here](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/), and inspired by many other colour pickers like [this one](https://oklch.com/). 

Was supposed to be modelled around a DJ deck, what with the two decks and the mixer in the middle, and the sans-serif font reminded me of Raw Data Feel / Endless. 

TODO
- [x] canvas going along the top with each end as the anchor colours, and a variable segmented palatte blend between (maybe up to 12 steps, 0 counting for a smooth transition if it's not too much of a performance hit)
- [ ] add input to vary step number in the palette
- [x] click to copy rgb / hex to clipboard. need this for at least the two anchors, but inbetween blends would be nice too
  - [x] got click function to work, just need to copy to clipboard, and a little prompt that should show up
- [x] pretty up the sliders and number input
- [x] add a bisection method for finding fallback colour. also have an option to clamp the cursor to the uppermost chroma
  - [x] added clamp functionality, just need an option to turn off or on
- [ ] add extra palettes on the side (chroma variable) and along the bottom (two anchors on each side, and gray at current lightness in the middle)
- [ ] apply fallback check for slider changes
