<h1 id="chainsaw-man">Chainsaw Man</h1>
<p>[[2025, 04, 19]] ### 1 - revs a chainsaw, but still hides behind
cover? - for the “animating is slow cinema” guy, I’m surprised by the
opening so suddenly, and not an extended intro - the fight scene skip is
treacherous - what do you mean water bill? You live in a shed? - again,
surprised that they went with a flashback from the “anime is cinema” guy
- there is one big reason why the tonality chosen for this and the
source material is so jarring – you impose realism into the setting,
which brings a lot of unintended side effects. I’m asking questions like
“how does he clean his sheets” and “why doesn’t he work in construction”
- i get that demons are dumb, but it was pretty obvious that denji is of
better use alive and working for you than dead - why not have an episode
arc where he looks like he’s going to finally get a break, before his
untimely death? basic episodic structure is ignored? We know he’s going
to live, so why draw it out? Why not even make us fight for it, sidestep
us? - the voice acting is obnoxiously subdued, even for the devils - i
want to see (at least the first episode of Dandadan) just to see where
the indsutry is up to - the action is UNBELIEVABLY sluggish,
interpolated like a robot, no impact frames, just really torturous to
get through, YEAH CUTTING WITH A CHAINSAW - the thing is, most directors
will identify this, and try to fix it. They might stylise it, play with
excessive editing, and cuts, whatever, but this guy, he jus - that’s
what Makima sounds like? like a teenager? on the casting notes for her
role, the words “MOTHER” wasn’t on there?!? - why would he ASK for the
HUG? she should have done that herself, identified the issue that there
was a scared little boy behind the facade. there was barely any time for
her to suss that out and shown how perceptive and powerful she was. -
OK, episode end, a lot of potential problems already. - Biggest one is
that Makima sounds like a high schooler. YOU DON’T NEED TO TRICK US INTO
REVEALING THAT SHE’S THE VILLAIN. She’s a hot woman in charge of the
“Devil hunting corporation”. I think it’s pretty obvious that she’s
hiding her powerlevel. You don’t need to casta high school voice on her
to hide that from us. I would be more interested not in the “IS SHE
EVIL?” question, and most so in the “WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO TO HIM”
question. A sultry, mature and warm voice would suit her so much better.
Denji right now does not need a calming sweet super-pop voice to calm
him down after a rampage. He needs a “everything is going to be alright.
I will take care of everything. Just close your eyes and sleep and
breakfast will be ready for you when you wake up” voice. “And dessert
maybe?” NO! DESSERT ONLY IF YOU EAT YOUR VEGGIES! YOU’RE SO SKINNY AND
PALE. Cmon, this is basic smothering. - THe action is insanely sluggish.
Yeah sure the 3d model isn’t helping, but YOU CONTROL THE FRAMES YOU PUT
ON THE SCREEN. this really is the naturaal consequence of the upscale
interpolated 60fps garbage that has proliferated the sakuga community
for the past decade. MAPPA is crazy clean with their lines, super thin,
a ton of compositing, and it really suits Ryuu’s directing style. To
adapt Chainsaw Man? I mean, i don’t really care that JJK and Dorohedoro
was made by the same guys, it’s probably shit as well. - Insane to write
this just from the first episode, but Ryuu’s talents are apparent, but
for someone that appreciates subtlety that much, you’re gonna forget the
biggest problem all art comes across – finding your audience. And
chainsaw man’s audience is definitely not the one. - I might do the
retrospective around this concept, but the idea of finding your audience
is that you have to know the boundaries of the audience in order to push
them. Too far, and the audience will reject it. And this isn’t to say
that the audience is too dumb to appreciate his choices. It’s no-one’s
fault, just two incompatible puzzle pieces from two different jigsaw
sets trying to mash into each other.</p>
<h3 id="section">2</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’ll be honest, as soon as she took off her jacket and the camera
didn’t immediately pan to her breasts in the tight dress shirt, I
realised Ryuu doesn’t have the sauce.</li>
<li>“Kick Back” feels like everything else, as someone who was watched
nothing</li>
<li>yeah, the tonal shifts into the jokes are offputting. Everyone still
talks like they’re doing a table read</li>
<li>everything just feels like the same thing. that kick was the slowest
kick ive ever seen</li>
<li>weird. modern convention would have him say “she saved my life” and
not responded to “is she a good person”</li>
<li>yeah yeah, they cut out the union bath chant</li>
<li>are we really flashbacking to the start of the episode? really?</li>
<li>they cut the power thrashing in her own filth arc. the general
public is too scared of true fem-rotting. MAPPA will pay for crimes of
not depicting Power’s true stench</li>
<li>that is the most sanitised version of whatever this could have been.
Purple? really</li>
<li>ok, like there isn’t enough to criticise, the ending is cute, but
Power’s room is way too clean. Why? Why are people afraid of true gender
equality. It’s not like the show has a shortage of hot girls</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-1">3</h3>
<ul>
<li>ok, good shot of her ass though</li>
<li>ok, there we go, some emotion in the voice acting</li>
<li>i like how she says “oh, my hatred of humans isn’t a social problem.
I’m just a fiend, that’s it.” Yeah, don’t worry about it,</li>
<li>the over reliance on ending themes for emotiona lsatisfaction, and
insistence on an OP’s job just as a signifier that things are gonna
happen in the show?</li>
<li>“put them to work” – embarrasing bit of dialogue, the confirmation
that large secretive corporations only have productivity in mind, even
that their goals can even be quantified by some shlub like us</li>
<li>EVERYTHING IS SO SLOW</li>
<li>the weird superman “save the civilian while fighting” stuff?</li>
<li>best ending so far ### 4</li>
<li>feeling the action now</li>
<li>the Kon was nice, needs more bass though, and there shouldn’t have
been a cut back to Aki’s face. Just the hand into frame, straight cut
into the wolf, no slow motion, one straight fluid motion if you’re not
gonna dunk a massive bass drop there</li>
<li>to be honest, ep 4 isn’t the worst time to do this</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-2">5</h3>
<ul>
<li>i’m actually so sick of the stuttered, gasping, too afraid
breathing. not that denji isn’t allowed to feel this way about someone
he likes, but it is sad that the first thing people go to as a folly of
man is the wife and not the mother. Cut’s too close to home i guess?
Denji should not be proposing anything with Makima. He is scared of her.
he should not be asking for sex.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-3">6</h3>
<ul>
<li>whereever i go, i see SCP 3333 everywhere</li>
<li>i mean, thats a good question. what type of time trap is this? what
are the mechanics? do you not age?</li>
<li>i DO REALLY LIKE these moments (the music is anooying though) but
theres TOO MUCH of these moments already.</li>
<li>yeah yeah i get it, the devil could have won if it was patient, but
that’s not the devil way is it?</li>
<li>kind of crazy that they didn’t rule out Denji turning into a
chainsaw immediately? Like, that’s the show? He’s Chainsaw man? he
solves all his problems by turning into a chainsaw? why not at least
rule that out at the start instead of spending expensive emotional beats
to labour over the solution?</li>
<li>ok ok, you’ve used the escher staircases for the second time now,
cmon</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-4">7</h3>
<ul>
<li>ok, you guys have got to learn that you can put the OP at the start
so you don’t fuck up the momentum</li>
<li>cmon, girl, you shoiuld have this figured out. You like him because
he is so singular in his quest to kill himself.</li>
<li>law of thermodynamics indicates that there will be energy loss in
the conversion of blood to ATP, so technically not a perpetual motion
machine. Devils still obey physics</li>
<li>i can’t believe they censored it</li>
<li>ending’s cute</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-5">8</h3>
<ul>
<li>i applaud the perspective shots, as if pairing the unease of the
assault with vomit wasn’t obvious enough,</li>
<li>his directing did shine with this sequence. it’s nice. it forces you
to slow down and confront what’s hapenning</li>
<li>ok ok, we’re spitting here</li>
<li>incredible</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-6">9</h3>
<ul>
<li>you know what’s my favourite part of the “magic” in chainsaw man?
everyone except for denji has non-regenerative powers. Finite resources.
Real stakes. that’s what separates power fantasies from real
tension.</li>
<li>and is why Makima’s (while cool and gory), feels a bit empty. Not
only does it not follow the equivalent exchange principle (really? two
people have to die?), she faces zero consequences (at least for
now)</li>
<li>“bullshit power” yeah i agree. this is how you get an audience to
hate a cool villain. but making them fucking bullshit</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-7">10</h3>
<ul>
<li>feels weird having the training arc now. just one of the many
difficulties adapting the manga to a series</li>
<li>taste and smell are actually great picks to lose, i guess touch too,
but the devil might recognise that it’s not really a sacrifice</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-8">11</h3>
<ul>
<li>yeah, again, the fiends are cool, shark guy is cool, but they really
lose any sort of bite when they do make the same sacrifices that the
humans make. also why Kobeni still feels distant to the audience. I
understand that they’re saving it for an emotional reveal, but until
then, you’ve sacrificed future payoff for current enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-9">12</h3>
<ul>
<li>yeah yeah yeah, the manga’s better. it’s dirty, rough, messy, the
blood spills like ink from a rushed mangaka on a deadline who takes a
few too many liberties with anatomy. But manga does not engage in more
than one of your senses. And judging from the other public safety
workers that sacrificed two of their senses for Future Devil’s power,
it’s worth a lot for us humans.</li>
</ul>
